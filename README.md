ABOUT this project 
this is a simple project in which one player has to choose some things which are 
1. Bet amount
2. Multiplier
3. Dificulty level

and after choosing these things if the user click on 'place bet' button the computer picks a multiplier (C_multiplier) 

If the C_multiplier is less than the multiplier chosen by user then the user lose its bet money and the bet money is deducted from wallet balance


If the C-multiplier is more than or equal to  the multiplier chosen by user then the user get the money multiplied by its bet money and bet money is dedcuted from its wallet balace but still he gets the earned money added in his wallet balance so you can say profit is added to its wallet 

and the C_mulitplier and the profit/loss is also shown in the screen .

MISSING-FEATURES
1.rule book 
2.error lists 
3.auto updation of level after each place bet (this is a flaw so be careful , update the level after each bet or the C_multiplier remains same)
